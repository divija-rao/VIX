# VIX
The VIX Saga explores the complex dynamics of market volatility using advanced time series models. Starting with SARIMA, which captures overall trends and seasonality, the analysis progresses to SARIMAX, incorporating key economic indicators for improved performance. The introduction of GARCH addresses volatility clustering, resulting in a SARIMAX-GARCH model that effectively captures both VIX levels and changing volatility. While this model shows significant improvements in residual analysis and forecasting accuracy, some limitations persist, highlighting the inherently unpredictable nature of financial markets. The exploration concludes by considering the potential of advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods, deep learning approaches, and gradient boosting algorithms to further enhance our understanding and forecasting of market volatility.

As a personal project stemming from my interest in financial markets and extending beyond a course project in my Financial Mathematics program, I embarked on exploring the complex dynamics of market volatility using advanced time series and machine learning models.

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the "fear index" or "fear gauge," is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices. Introduced in 1993, VIX has become an essential tool for investors and analysts to gauge market sentiment and potential future market movements. It is calculated using a complex formula that considers the implied volatilities of a wide range of S&P 500 index options.

Time series models have traditionally been the first choice for VIX analysis due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data. These models, such as SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMAX (SARIMA with exogenous variables), are particularly well-suited for analyzing the VIX index because they can account for trends, seasonality, and the influence of external factors on market volatility. The GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model further enhances this analysis by addressing volatility clustering, a common phenomenon in financial markets.

However, as financial markets have become increasingly complex and data-rich, researchers and practitioners have turned to machine learning models to capture more intricate patterns and non-linear relationships in VIX data. Machine learning approaches, including ensemble methods, deep learning techniques, and gradient boosting algorithms, offer the potential to uncover hidden patterns and improve forecasting accuracy beyond what traditional time series models can achieve. These advanced techniques can process vast amounts of data from diverse sources, potentially leading to more robust and accurate predictions of market volatility.

This project explores the complex dynamics of market volatility using advanced time series models. Starting with SARIMA, which captures overall trends and seasonality, the analysis progresses to SARIMAX, incorporating key economic indicators for improved performance. The introduction of GARCH addresses volatility clustering, resulting in a SARIMAX-GARCH model that effectively captures both VIX levels and changing volatility. While this model shows significant improvements in residual analysis and forecasting accuracy, some limitations persist, highlighting the inherently unpredictable nature of financial markets. The exploration concludes by considering the potential of advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods, deep learning approaches, and gradient boosting algorithms to further enhance our understanding and forecasting of market volatility.

The models predicted VIX forecast to increase to a mean of 20.11 and median of 19.70, higher than the current trading value of 15.27, suggesting potential for a long straddle, long strangle and long VIX call options strategies.
